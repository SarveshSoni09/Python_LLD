# Stack Overflow System: Low-Level Design (LLD)

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the Low-Level Design (LLD) for a **Q&A Platform**, modeled after Stack Overflow. The system is designed to allow users to post questions, provide answers, engage in discussions through comments, and build a reputation based on community feedback. It emphasizes efficient searching, content organization via tags, and data consistency in a concurrent environment.

## 2. System Requirements

The design addresses the following core functional requirements:

1.  **Content Creation:** Users must be able to post **Questions**, **Answers**, and **Comments**.
2.  **Voting System:** The system must allow users to **upvote** and **downvote** questions and answers to signify quality.
3.  **Content Organization:** Questions must be categorized using one or more **Tags** for easy discovery.
4.  **Search Functionality:** Users must be able to search for questions based on **keywords**, **tags**, or **users**.
5.  **Reputation Management:** The system must track and assign a **reputation score** to users based on their contributions and the community's votes.
6.  **Concurrency:** The system must handle simultaneous user interactions (e.g., multiple users voting on the same answer) in a thread-safe manner.

## 3. Low-Level Components

The design is composed of the following core classes and enumerations:

### Classes

| Component               | Type  | Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`StackOverflow`**     | Class | The **central facade** of the system. Manages users, questions, and tags, providing a simplified interface for all primary operations like posting, searching, and voting.        |
| **`User`**              | Class | Represents a user account. Manages user details like username and email, and tracks their **reputation score**.                                                                   |
| **`Question`**          | Class | Represents a user-submitted question. Contains the title, content, author, a collection of `Answer` objects, `Comment` objects, and associated `Tag` objects. Tracks vote counts. |
| **`Answer`**            | Class | Represents a user-submitted answer to a `Question`. Contains its content, author, and a collection of `Comment` objects. Tracks vote counts.                                      |
| **`Comment`**           | Class | Represents a comment attached to either a `Question` or an `Answer`. Contains its text content and author.                                                                        |
| **`Tag`**               | Class | Represents a metadata tag used for categorizing questions. Contains the tag name.                                                                                                 |
| **`Vote`**              | Class | Represents a single upvote or downvote cast by a `User` on a `Question` or `Answer`.                                                                                              |
| **`StackOverflowDemo`** | Class | Contains the application entry point (`main` method) to demonstrate the creation and interaction of the system's components.                                                      |

### Enumerations

| Enumeration    | Definition                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`VoteType`** | Defines the type of vote that can be cast (e.g., `UPVOTE`, `DOWNVOTE`). This is crucial for calculating post scores and user reputation.         |
| **`PostType`** | Defines the type of content being voted on (e.g., `QUESTION`, `ANSWER`). This allows the `Vote` and reputation logic to be generic and reusable. |

## 4. Design Patterns & Concurrency

### Design Patterns Used

The design incorporates several key patterns:

1.  **Singleton Pattern:** Applied to the **`StackOverflow`** class.

    - **Rationale:** The system needs a single, globally accessible entry point to manage the shared state of all questions, users, and tags. This ensures data consistency and avoids conflicting states that could arise from multiple instances.

2.  **Facade Pattern:** The **`StackOverflow`** class also acts as a facade.
    - **Rationale:** It provides a simplified, high-level API (e.g., `postQuestion()`, `searchByTag()`) that hides the complex underlying interactions between the `User`, `Question`, `Answer`, `Vote`, and `Tag` objects.

### Concurrency Strategy

To ensure data integrity with many users accessing the system simultaneously, **critical sections of code that modify shared data will be synchronized.**

Key operations requiring synchronization include:

- **Casting a vote:** Modifying the vote count on a `Question` or `Answer` must be an atomic operation to prevent lost updates.
- **Updating reputation:** A user's reputation score must be updated atomically when their posts receive upvotes or downvotes.
- **Adding content:** Posting an answer to a question or a comment to a post involves modifying a shared collection, which must be done in a thread-safe manner.

These operations will use mechanisms like the **locks** to ensure that only one thread can modify a shared resource at any given time, thus preventing race conditions.
